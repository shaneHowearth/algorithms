# Classic sorting algorithm examples
## Bubble Sort
Worst Case Performance O(n²)
Average Case Performance O(n²)
Best Case Performance O(n), list is already sorted.

## Insertion Sort //TODO
Worst Case Performance O(n²)
Average Case Performance O(n²)
Best Case Performance O(n), list is already sorted.
Worst Case Space Complexity O(n) total, O(1) auxiliary.

## Heap Sort // TODO
Worst Case Performance O(n log n)
Average Case O(n log n)
Best Case Performance O(n log n), distinct keys, O(n) equal keys.
Worst Case Space Complexity O(n) total, O(1) auxiliary.

## Merge Sort
Worst Case Performance O(n log n)
Average Case O(n log n)
Best Case Performance O(n log n), typical, O(n) O(n).
Worst Case Space Complexity O(n) total, O(n) auxiliary (O(1) auxiliary with linked lists).

## Quicksort
Worst Case Performance O(n²)
Average Case Performance O(n log n)
Best Case Performance O(n log n), simple partition, O(n) three way partition and equal keys.
Worst Case Space Complexity O(n) auxiliary , (O(log n) Hoare, 1962).
